CS255 Project 1 Milestone 1 README
==================================

1) Secure Key Storage Database

2) New Key Generation

We use the cryptographic primitives provided by Google Chrome and other Webkit 
browsers with the window.crypto.getRandomValues function, as suggested by the
handout.

3) Encrypt and Decryption Functions

We chose to implement AES-CTR-128 for encryption and decryption because of its
simplicity and ease of implementation.

Our message format is length (4-bytes) || nonce (16-bytes) || message blocks

4) Message Authentication Code

TODO: NEED TO IMPLEMENT AES MAC

5) Comments about Cryptography in the Browser
